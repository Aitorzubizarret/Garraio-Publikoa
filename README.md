#  Garraio Publikoa

'Garraio Publikoa' means 'Public Transport' in Basque language.

## What is this?

This is a project (iOS App) that shows the available public transport around you using the information given by the government and/or public companies. It's mainly focused in the public transport of the Basque Country.


## App Icon
